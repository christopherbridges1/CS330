CS330 Module 8 

How do I approach designing software?
  My software design process begins by thinking about the requirements. What do I need the software to accomplish, how should it function? 
  I start with the larger requirements and then work my way down to the smaller objectives and preferences like color and asthetics.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  With this project, I learned about lighting, textures, and using OpenGL to create a three dimensional space with objects.
  I improved my skills with object placement and how to create complex objects from siple shapes.
  I learned how to use textures and shading to make an object appear more realistic.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I started by choosing a few objects and rendering them in three dimensions. From there, I applied textures, shaders, and lighting. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I think starting with the basic shapes, getting the proper placement and appearance should be priority.
  After the object is properly located, applying textures, shaders, and lighting would be much easier.

How do I approach developing programs?
  With programs I use the same method. Start from the most important requirements and work my way into smaller details.
  It doesn't matter how your program looks if it doesn't function.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  I created each of the objects and functions to be modular.
  They can be commented out, or copied to another project with little effort.
  This makes the code more reusable and easier to maintain. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
  Creating the complex objects and placement required several iterations. It took more attempts than I can admit for me to be happy with the final placement.
  These iterations involved adjusting each object until I was happy. 
  Initialization, shading, texturing, and lighting were each done in different iterations for the assignments. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  In my past courses, I've had to play with functions for them to work as expected, but in this class I had to manipulate objects.
  Moving each object little by little, until it was where I wanted it. 
  It's a different mindset than debating on switch statements or loops. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science can help me gain the skills and knowledge I need to succeed in a tech role.
  Knowing how to code and having an understanding of the overall process is much better than learning via youtube or on your own.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Learning how objects are created and rendered gives me a better understanding and appreciation for the people who do this work.
  I feel comfortable using OpenGL to create scenes similar to the assignment now, before I had very little knowledge about how it worked.
